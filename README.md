# Architecture Patterns for Scalable SaaS Systems

These architecture patterns are based on designs I have implemented, along with a few advanced patterns (such as RAG + VectorDB) that are currently on my engineering roadmap. They are written in a fully generic way so they can be applied to any system that requires scalability, extensibility, scope-based isolation, or dynamic configuration.

The patterns come from real-world design decisions and practical challenges, but all product-specific and domain-specific details have been removed.

## Purpose

The goal of these articles is to document reusable architecture patterns that address real-world scaling challenges in distributed, multi-layered SaaS systems. The concepts are fully generic and can be applied to any platform that requires isolation, extensibility, configurability, or predictable behavior across scopes.

All articles describe architectural design principles only. No product-specific terminology, logic, or implementation details are included.
